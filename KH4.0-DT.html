              <p>Font Size
                This one is self-explanatory. You’ll need to set up how large you’d like your font to be before you can set up the rest of your gradient. Working with font size in CSS is based on EMS, pixels, points, and percentages. You might need to look up conversions, but typically you can expect 1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%.
                
                Direction
                Your text gradient isn’t so different from your linear gradient, specifically when it comes to direction. You can define the linear gradient angle in the code with a keyword or number and unit. With a keyword, you would use variations of to bottom, to top, to left, and to right to determine where the line should move to from the starting point. These directional keywords can be combined-like to top right or to bottom left-to create a diagonal line. You could also use number and unit pairings to determine the angle and direction of the line.
                
                Colors and Color Stops
                In the most basic version of a CSS gradients, you'll need is at least two colors for the gradient to transition between. These are typically referred to as color-stops since, generally, they tell the code at which points each color should stop along the text gradient. These colors can be set as any type: named, HEX, RGB, or HSL. Because of this, there are a lot of different options when it comes to how your gradient can be shown.

							<p>Font Size
                This one is self-explanatory. You’ll need to set up how large you’d like your font to be before you can set up the rest of your gradient. Working with font size in CSS is based on EMS, pixels, points, and percentages. You might need to look up conversions, but typically you can expect 1em = 12pt = 16px = 100%.
                
                Direction
                Your text gradient isn’t so different from your linear gradient, specifically when it comes to direction. You can define the linear gradient angle in the code with a keyword or number and unit. With a keyword, you would use variations of to bottom, to top, to left, and to right to determine where the line should move to from the starting point. These directional keywords can be combined-like to top right or to bottom left-to create a diagonal line. You could also use number and unit pairings to determine the angle and direction of the line.
                
                Colors and Color Stops
                In the most basic version of a CSS gradients, you'll need is at least two colors for the gradient to transition between. These are typically referred to as color-stops since, generally, they tell the code at which points each color should stop along the text gradient. These colors can be set as any type: named, HEX, RGB, or HSL. Because of this, there are a lot of different options when it comes to how your gradient can be shown.
